<text>A strange place. The silent building keeps its secrets, but everyone is more interested in stalking and artefacts, often found in the area. You can profit, but you can also lose your life. Let your body be quick, and the aim true, then success will certainly come to you.

<string id="ui_map_desc_mp_atp_large">
 
<text>A trolleybus parking lot, located in the heart of the Zone. Tractors, buses, trucks, all litter the place... Artefacts have been sighted here, but this place is more popular among looters, who scavenge and pass time by shooting upstart rookies. Shelter can be found in buildings and vehicles. Beware of enemies on the rooftops!

<text>A mysterious place, with a strange attraction: an experimental pool, not known by whom and for what it was built. Not the best artifact source, so stalkers only come here except for remains of strange machines and devices. Watch the roofs closely, and remember that the radiation level here is very high.

<string id="ui_map_desc_mp_garbage_large">
 
<text>This is a part of large landfill sites, where mountains of radioactive waste and equipment grew overnight after the 1986 accident. In addition to the broken crane, wrecks of cars and various other tech can be found decaying in the shadow of skeletons of old buildings and a huge hangar. This part of the Zone is located not far from Cordon, but is rich in artifacts. Many stalkers look here for easy money.
